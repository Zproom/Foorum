# Foorum

## Overview

Foorum is a simple web forum that enables users to submit posts on discussion boards with distinct topics. Signed in users are able to create and edit posts on each board and can like and comment on other users' posts. Users also have the ability to follow other users and can view those users' posts in a separate page. If given permission by an administrator, users may create new discussion boards. The app utilizes Python (Django framework) on the back-end to enable users to create new posts and boards, sort posts, and follow and unfollow other users. On the front-end, JavaScript lets users create new comments and edit and like posts and comments via the app's API. To embed media, the app uses the django-embed-video app. The app is hosted on Heroku and uses a PostgreSQL database provided by Heroku. The live website uses AWS S3 for storing media files.

## How to Use

To start using the app, complete the following steps:

1. `cd` into the `Foorum` directory.
2. Run `python3 manage.py makemigrations` to make migrations for the project apps.
3. Run `python3 manage.py migrate` to apply migrations to your database.
4. Run `python3 manage.py runserver` to launch the app. You will notice that there are no boards and no other users. Create boards by submitting forms on the All Boards page or...
5. Create one or more superusers who can create, edit, and delete any of the models in Foorum by running `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`. To use the admin app, go to the URL "http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/" and sign in with your superuser's credentials. The admin app offers a quick way to populate Foorum with content. You can also create regular users by signing out and clicking the Register link at the top of the page. 
6. To give regular users the ability to create new boards as an admin, go to the admin app and click "Users". Click on the appropriate user in the list and next to "User permissions" control click "forum|board|Can add board". 

## Models

Foorum includes the following models:
- User
- Post
- Board

The **User** model stores information about each user, including the users they follow, their followers, and the posts and comments they have liked. 

The **Post** model stores information about each post on a discussion board. This includes the post's author, the post's associated discussion board, the post's content, an optional image and video, the post's like count, and the post's timestamp. The Post model is used for both top-level posts and comments on posts. 

The **Board** model stores a discussion board's name and description.

The **Comment** model stores information about a comment on a post. In particular, it stores a comment's author, associated post, content, like count, and timestamp. This model also stores an optional image. 

## Templates

Foorum is a multipage application that comprises six HTML files, listed below.
- layout.html (layout inherited by each template)
- login.html (login page)
- register.html (new user registration page) 
- index.html
- posts.html
- comments.html

**index.html** is the page all users land on when opening Foorum. It lists all of the existing discussion boards as links. Users who have been granted permission by an administrator also see a form for creating new discussion boards below the list of boards.

**posts.html** is a page that is used to present listed posts. In particular, this page is displayed when: (1) any user clicks on a link to a discussion board; (2) any user clicks on a username in a post or comment; or (3) a signed in user clicks the "Following" link at the top of the screen (users who are not signed in cannot see the link to this page). The content of the page changes depending on which of the three links is opened. In a discussion board (1), users can see the name and description of the board and a sortable list of posts associated with the board. Signed in users also see a form to create new posts. A profile page (2) shows the user's follower count, following count (number of users they follow), and all of the user's posts in reverse chronological order. Signed in users also have the ability to follow and unfollow the user. The following page (3) displays all posts authored by users followed by the signed in user.

**comments.html** is the page all users see after clicking on the Comments button under a post. The page displays the original post and all of the comments associated with the post in reverse chronological order. Signed in users also see a form to create new comments. 
 
## Static Files

The **static** directory contains a JavaScript file and a CSS file.

- script.js
- styles.css

**script.js** creates a dynamic user interface for the app. In particular, it lets users create new comments, edit posts and comments, and like posts and comments using the app's API. To create comments and edit comments and top-level posts, the script uses Ajax requests. The app uses JavaScript from Bootstrap and Popper to create a dropdown sort button on each board. Since video embedding in this app relies on template tags, users must reload the page to view updates to embdedded media.

**styles.css** styles the app's templates and helps make the app mobile-responsive. The app uses Bootstrap and Font Awesome for additional styling (e.g. buttons and the like icon).

The remaining static files are the image files in board headers and posts. These are stored in a separate media directory.
